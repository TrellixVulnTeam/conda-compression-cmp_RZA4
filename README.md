## Conda Compression Format Study

This presents a brief study about possible benefits when using compression
algorithms other than `.bz2` for conda packages.

In order to reproduce the results, make sure to clone this repository recursively,
run `make` in all the three submodules, then adjust the path to your miniconda or
anaconda installation in `run-all.sh` and run `run-all.sh`.
